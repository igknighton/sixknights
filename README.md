There are six knights, three white and three black, on opposite sides of a 3x4 chessboard. This program finds the minimum number of moves required for these knights to exchange places.The chessboard is represented as a graph and the problem is solved using the BFS graph algorithm. The structure of the graph comes from the geometry of the board and the particual way a knight moves on a chessboard.
